Image Profile Fitting
=====================

Fit guassian curve to horizontal/vertical profiles
computed from an image (or any 1-d curves)

Input is a single double array.
Results include a matching array with the fit waveform,
and a pair of 2 element "marker" waveforms which can be
rendered as an x/y plot to show the location of the mean
along with the raw and fit data.
